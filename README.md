For Module 9: Data Storage and Retrival 

# Overview of the Analysis 
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze the temperature trends of Oahu in June and December.  This is so that a potential investor for a hypothetical surf shop can invest with peace of mind, knowing that the weather won't wash out the sales for the shop.

# Summary 
We can see from the results that the average difference in temperatures from June versus December are not very different.  The largest difference is with the minimum temperature, which is 8 points lower than the June minimum temperature.  June does have higher averages in general, but the difference is only by a few points.  This may impact the sales, but I don't think it will have a strong impact due to having minimal changes. 

Further analysis could be done by looking at the temperatures per year and seeing if there are any trends in the temperature per month.
